# DApps — decentralized apps developed with The Internet Computer, which is a world computer blockchain that can host a social network or large enterprise system and removes the need for centralized IT.


This is a repository of projects exploring the development of decentralized apps with Internet Computer incorporating blockchain technology.



Documentation available online:

- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/build/install-upgrade-remove)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd hello/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`NODE_ENV` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor


# PROJECTS:
# hello_01
This is the starter project from Internet Computer: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/quickstart/hello10mins.
It simply renders text from the input HTML tag on the screen after pressing the button. This is a perfect place to start, set up your environment, and get familiar with the structure.

# dbank_02
This is a banking app where the user starts with a deposit of $300  and can perform transactions by adding and taking out money. Each time the user performs a transaction, the sum will be added together by the time between transactions; this is implemented on the backend side with Motoko to show the functionality of additional transactions.

# dkeeper_app_03
This web app presents the option of making dynamic lists. On the home page, the user will see an input saying "Take a note..." and after navigating the cursor in this field, the note will expand and give the option for the user to fill in the title and the content of the note. With a plus button, the note can be added to the home page. Each note that was added can also be deleted with the "trash bin" button. This decentralized app shows how to connect frontend developed with React.js and backend developed in motoko (Interent Computer). All data is stored and manged on a canister, and after refreshing the website it will still be availabe because it is stored on the backend.
